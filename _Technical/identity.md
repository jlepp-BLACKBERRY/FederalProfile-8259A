## Asset Identifier Support

Ability for device identification. Elements that may be necessary:

- Ability to uniquely identify the IoT device physically.
- Ability to uniquely identify the IoT device logically.
- Ability to uniquely identify a remote IoT device.
- Ability for the IoT device to support a unique identifier (e.g., to allow it to be linked to the person or process assigned to use the IoT device).

## Actions Based on Device Identity

Actions that can occur based on or using the identity of the device. Elements that may be necessary:

- Ability to configure IoT device access control policies using IoT device identity.
  - Ability to hide IoT device identity from non-authorized entities.
  - Ability for the IoT device to differentiate between authorized and unauthorized remote users.
  - Ability for the IoT device to differentiate between authorized and unauthorized physical device users.
- Ability to monitor specific actions based on IoT device identity.
- Ability to identify software loaded on the IoT device based on IoT device identity.

## Device Authentication Support

Actions to support local or interfaced device authentication. Elements that may be necessary:

- Ability for the IoT device to identify itself as an authorized entity to other devices.
- Ability to verify the identity of an IoT device.
