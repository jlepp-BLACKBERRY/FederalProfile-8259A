# Data Protection

_See also the [technical counterpart to this section](../_8259-Catalog/protection.md)_

The management and operational controls to support securing IoT device data according to organizationally-defined requirements. 

## Policies and procedures for IOT device security roles.

Policies and procedures provide the details necessary to implement management and operational controls for establishing roles and responsibilities for IoT device security. Controls that may be necessary:

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide documentation describing the IoT device capabilities for role-based controls, to establish different roles within the IOT device.

**Agency:**

- Use the manufacturer documentation to establish policies and procedures for IoT device security and privacy roles and responsibilities, such as for the roles to authorize IOT devices, audit IOT devices, etc.
- Create and provide training to those who will be responsible for using the IoT devices to teach them how to set and change the role-based settings.

## Policies and procedures for IOT device integrity.

Policies and procedures provide the details necessary to implement management and operational controls to support IoT device and associated systems data integrity, including establishing the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination of IoT devices among organizational entities, and the associated compliance activities. Controls that may be necessary:

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide information to the IoT device customer for the role/position within the organization that is responsible for determining the security and privacy regulatory requirements with which the IoT device capabilities comply.

**Agency:**

- Implement IoT device and associated systems information integrity policies and procedures that govern establishing the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination of IoT devices among organizational entities, and the associated compliance activities.
- Provide training covering the IoT device purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination of IoT devices among organizational entities, and the associated compliance activities.
- Perform periodic audits to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures.

## Policies and procedures implementation of IOT device integrity controls.

Policies and procedures provide the details necessary to implement management and operational controls that support secure implementation of the IOT device and associated systems data integrity controls. Controls that may be necessary:

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide documentation describing the integrity controls built into the IoT device and how to use them.
- If there are no integrity controls built into the IoT device, explain ways to achieve IoT device data integrity.

**Agency:**

- Document the data integrity capabilities for the associated IoT device, such as for validating accuracy of input data, and how to ensure integrity if this action is not part of the device's technical capabilities.

## Policies and procedures maintaining IOT device data integrity.

Policies and procedures provide the details necessary to implement management and operational controls for reviewing and updating the current IoT device and associated systems data integrity at a minimum established organizationlly-defined frequency, and following organizationally-defined specified trigger events. Controls that may be necessary:

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide information to IoT device customers for the trigger events that result in updates to their IoT devices.
- Establish a process to consistently provide communications to their IoT device customers about updates to the IoT devices.

**Agency:**

- Implement a policy and procedure to review and update, manually or using automated means, the current IoT device and associated systems information/data integrity:
  - At a minimum established organizationally-defined frequency, and
  - Following organizationally-defined specified trigger events.

## Policies and procedures for IOT device data handling and retention.

Policies and procedures provide the details necessary to implement management and operational controls for securely handling and retaining IOT device data, associated systems data, and data output from the IOT device, in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements. Controls that may be necessary:

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide documentation to IoT device users describing how to wipe/delete data from the IoT device.
- Provide information to IoT device users describing how to protect device data from being accidentally modified.

**Agency:**

- Implement policies and procedures establishing the requirements for:
  - Securely handling IoT devices to prevent loss, theft and damage.
  - Physical access security to the device.
  - Allowing for removable storage devices to be inserted into the device.  
  - Securely retaining IoT devices, and associated systems, after they are no longer used, along with associated retention time requirements.
  - Securely retaining IoT device data within the associated information systems, and data output from the IoT device, in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements.
  - Appropriately marking or labeling device hardware to support distribution, handling, or dissemination of the devices throughout the organization. 
- Implement policies and procedures for secure disposal of IoT device hardware, software and data following expiration of the established retention period.
- Provide training to those responsible for IoT device retention and disposal.
- Perform periodic audits for the IoT device retention and disposal policies and procedures.
