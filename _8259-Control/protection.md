# Data Protection

**IOT Device System and Information Integrity**

## The organization develops policies and procedures to establish roles and responsibilities for IOT device security.

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide documentation describing the IOT device capabilities for role-based controls, to establish different roles within the IOT device.

**Agency:**

- Use the manufacturer documentation to establish policies and procedures for IOT device security and privacy roles and responsibilities, such as for the roles to authorize IOT devices, audit IOT devices, etc.
- Create and provide training to those who will be responsible for using the IOT devices to teach them how to set and change the role-based settings.

## IOT device and associated systems information integrity policies and procedures cover establishing the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination of IOT devices among organizational entities, and the associated compliance activities.

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide information to the IOD device customer for the role/position within their organization that is responsible for determining the security and privacy regulatory requirements with which the IOT device capabilities comply.

**Agency:**

- Implement IOT device and associated systems information integrity policies and procedures that govern establishing the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination of IOT devices among organizational entities, and the associated compliance activities.
- Provide training covering the IOT device purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination of IOT devices among organizational entities, and the associated compliance activities.
- Perform periodic audits to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures.

## Policies and procedures facilitate secure implementation of the IOT device and associated systems information integrity policy controls.

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide documentation describing the integrity controls built into the IOT device and how to use them.
- If there are no integrity controls built into the IOT device, explain ways to achieve IOT device data integrity.

**Agency:**

- Document the requirements for data integrity for the associated IOT device, such as for validating accuracy of input data, and how to ensure integrity if this action is not part of the device&#39;s technical capabilities.

## Policies and procedures establish requirements to review and update the current IOT device and associated systems information/data integrity at a minimum established organization-defined frequency, and following organization-defined specified trigger events.

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide information to IOT device customers for the trigger events that result in updates to their IOT devices.
- Establish a process to consistently provide communications to their IOT device customers about updates to the IOT devices.

**Agency:**

- Implement a policy and procedure requirements to review and update, manually or using automated means, the current IOT device and associated systems information/data integrity:
  - At a minimum established organization-defined frequency, and
  - Following organization-defined specified trigger events.

**IOT Device Information Handling and Retention**

## Policies and procedures establish requirements for securely handling and retaining IOT devices, and associated systems, information within the associated information systems, and information output from the IOT device, in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements.

**Manufacturer:**

- Provide documentation to IOT device users describing how to wipe data from the IOT device.
- Provide information to IOT device users describing how to protect devices from being accidentally modified.

**Agency:**

- Implement policies and procedures establishing the requirements for
  - Securely handling IOT devices to prevents loss, theft and damage;
  - How to securely retain IOT devices, and associated systems, after they are no longer used, along with associated retention time requirements.
  - How to securely retain IOT device data within the associated information systems, and information output from the IOT device, in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements.
- Implement policies and procedures for secure disposal of IOT device hardware, software and data following expiration of the established retention period.
- Provide training to those responsible for IOT device retention and disposal.
- Perform periodic audits for the IOT device retention and disposal policies and procedures.
