# Device Identity

_See also the [technical counterpart to this section](../_8259-Catalog/identity.md)_

**Organizational Security Policies and Procedures**

## Policies and procedures allowing only the use of IOT devices within the organization system that are on the FIPS 201-approved products list for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) capability implemented within organizational information systems, as applicable to the use and purpose for each IOT device unless [put the types of situations here.].
 This would be the responsibility of the Manufacturer/End user/Both?


**Manufacturer:**

- Provides documentation describing how their IOT device can technically support PIV card implementation, accessibility and interfaces.
- If their IOT device cannot support PIV cards, they provide information with suggested ways in which their customers can implement compensating controls around their IOT device.
- Provides training videos showing how to configure IOT device to technically support PIV implementation, accessibility and interfaces.
- Provides instructions for how to integrate their IOT device with a PIV system. Or, provides some type of attestation that their IOT device can be used in compliance with Fed agency requirements, with associated descriptions for how the agency can accomplish this.

**Agency:**

- Policies and procedures provide the requirements for how to use IOT devices
  - That have PIV card support provided by the manufacturer; and
  - That do not have PIV card support.
- Training provides the information to roles responsible for implementing IOT devices that need to support PIV capabilities.
- Establish processes to communicate with IOT device manufacturer about any problems or to ask any questions about IOT devices and related support of PIV cards.

## Organizational IOT device policies and procedures establish the required unique identification for each IOT device associated with the system and critical system components within which it is used.

**Manufacturer:**

- Provides capabilities within IOT devise to allow for unique identification of each IOT device.
- Provides instructions for implementing and using the unique IOT identifiers.
- Provides training videos showing how to implement unique identifiers for their IOT device.

**Agency:**

- Organizational IOT device policies and procedures establish the unique identification required for each IOT device associated with the system and critical system components within which it is used.
