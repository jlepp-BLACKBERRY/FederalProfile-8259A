# NIST Needs Your Feedback

NIST is asking for feedback on this initial catalog for the Federal Profile through the following questions:

1. For any given technical capability and sub-capability, have we identified the most common, or expected, device cybersecurity capability or sub-capability that should be built within an IoT device?
2. Are there any common IoT device technical cybersecurity capabilities or sub-capabilities that we have not included? Please describe.
3. Do you have any suggested updates or additions to elements of device cybersecurity capabilities and sub-capabilities, or suggestions for re-arranging the elements (for technical capabilities) or actions (for non-technical capabilities)? Please describe.
4. Is this structure (i.e., capability -> sub-capability -> element / action) useful for defining device cybersecurity capabilities and IoT device customer controls?
5. Are there any common IoT device non-technical manufacturer capabilities or IoT device customer controls that we have not included? Please describe.
6. Do you have any suggested updates or additions to the non-technical capabilities and associated actions for either the manufacturer or the federal agency? Please describe.
7. Do you find it useful to have the technical capabilities catalog separate from the non-technical capabilities and controls catalog? Why or why not?
8. Would mapping the catalog elements to NISTIR 8259A, NIST SP 800-53 (Rev 4 or Rev 5), or the NIST Cybersecurity Framework be helpful? Are there any other mappings that would also be useful?
