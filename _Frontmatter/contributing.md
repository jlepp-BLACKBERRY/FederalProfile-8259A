# Introduction 

IoT devices may create new pathways in and out of the network systems within which they are used. These issues make controlling the secure use of IoT devices within networking systems a new and challenging task. It is also challenging when trying to identify and mitigate the cybersecurity risks and then effectively protect the associated IoT data, interfaces and linked systems.

## NIST Guidance

NIST has developed extensive guidance over the years for cybersecurity, which also supports implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). These guidance documents are usually intended for securing Federal information systems that incorporate more traditional components involving computing systems such as hard-wired and wireless networks, mainframes, fileservers, and endpoints such as laptops and printers. However, IoT devices create new cybersecurity and privacy risks that fall outside of these traditionally used devices.

NISTIR 8259 provides manufacturers with guidance for identifying an initial core baseline of device cybersecurity capabilities and foundational activities to consider throughout the product development process. The core baseline and foundational activities are intended to help enable IoT device manufacturers to make their IoT devices securable to give IoT device customers the cybersecurity capabilities to meet their security goals.

## IoT Device Cybersecurity Capabilities

With the release of NISTIR 8259 and NISTIR 8259A, NIST is now establishing a catalog of IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-technical manufacturer capabilities and associated IoT device customer controls that are shown in this GitHub page. Manufacturers can engineer the technical capabilities and provide non-technical capabilities to IoT device customers, who can then use those capabilities to support their need to ensure their systems meet an established level of management, operational and technical security controls requirements. The capabilities needed for each IoT device will depend upon the risks that the device brings to the system within which it is implemented.

From the final version of this initial catalog of IoT device cybersecurity technical capabilities and non-technical controls, a subset of the IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and controls (which from this point on will be referred to as the “Federal profile”) will be established. The Federal profile will represent the minimum technical and non-technical capabilities and non-technical controls necessary for every type of IoT device used within Federal information systems. To mitigate the risks that some types of IoT devices will introduce, agencies may also need to use additional capabilities and controls found within the catalog. This determination of additional capabilities and controls from the catalog will depend upon a risk assessment. The Federal profile may also be useful to non-Federal organizations, or they may choose to create their own baseline profiles by choosing a different set of capabilities and controls elements from the catalog.

Ultimately, the goal is to enable Federal agencies to securely incorporate IoT devices into their systems and meet their minimum security requirements for Federal information and information systems. The future Federal profile should help manufacturers looking at Federal customers and use cases to go beyond identifying the types of cybersecurity capabilities listed in the NISTIR 8259 table, to considering the additionally needed technical and non-technical cybersecurity capabilities .

## We need your feedback

NIST has developed an initial set of IoT device cybersecurity technical and non-technical capabilities and controls based primarily on the guidance used by Federal agencies in SP 800-53 Rev 5 to support subsequently creating a Federal profile of the IoT device cybersecurity capabilities core baseline. NIST analyzed and created a two-part catalog; one part listing possible device technical cybersecurity capabilities elements and the other part listing possible supporting non-technical capabilities and controls.

This new catalog builds on the structure of NISTIR 8259A by expanding the depth of definitions for technical capabilities through new sub-levels of detail known as “sub-capabilities” that would be considered when the associated higher-level capability is used. This same structure is also represented in the catalog of non-technical capabilities and supporting controls.

We ask for your feedback on the material we have created. Please answer some or all of the following questions: 1. For any given technical capability and sub-capability, have we identified the most common, or expected, device cybersecurity capability or sub-capability that should be built within an IoT device?

2. Are there any common IoT device technical cybersecurity capabilities or sub-capabilities that we have not included? Please describe.

3. Do you have any suggested updates or additions to elements of device cybersecurity capabilities and sub-capabilities, or suggestions for re-arranging the elements? Please describe.

4. Are there any common IoT device non-technical manufacturer capabilities or IoT device customer controls that we have not included? Please describe.

5. Do you have any suggested updates or additions to the non-technical capabilities and controls? Please describe.

6. Do you find it useful to have the technical capabilities catalog separate from the non-technical capabilities and controls catalog? Why or why not?

7. Is this structure (i.e., capability->sub-capability->element) useful for defining device cybersecurity capabilities and controls? 8. Would mapping the catalog elements to NISTIR 8259A and SP 800-53 Rev 5 and the CSF be helpful?
