# Introduction

IoT devices may create new pathways in and out of the network systems within which they are used. These issues make controlling the secure use of IoT devices within networking systems a new and challenging task. It is also challenging when trying to identify and mitigate the cybersecurity risks and then effectively protect the associated IoT data, interfaces and linked systems.

## NIST Guidance

NIST has developed extensive guidance over the years for cybersecurity, which also supports implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). These guidance documents are usually intended for securing federal information systems that incorporate more traditional components involving computing systems such as hard-wired and wireless networks, mainframes, fileservers, and endpoints such as laptops and printers. However, IoT devices create new cybersecurity and privacy risks that fall outside of these traditionally used devices.

NISTIR 8259 provides manufacturers with guidance for identifying an initial core baseline of device cybersecurity capabilities and foundational activities to consider throughout the product development process. The core baseline and foundational activities are intended to help IoT device manufacturers make their IoT devices securable, giving IoT device customers the cybersecurity capabilities to meet their security goals.

## IoT Device Cybersecurity Capabilities

With the release of NISTIR 8259 and NISTIR 8259A, NIST is now establishing a catalog of IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-technical manufacturer capabilities and associated IoT device customer controls that are shown within this GitHub page. Manufacturers can engineer the technical capabilities and provide non-technical capabilities to IoT device customers, who can then use those capabilities to ensure their systems meet an established level of management, operational and technical security controls requirements. The capabilities needed for each IoT device will depend upon the risks that the device brings to the system within which it is implemented.

NIST has developed this initial catalog of IoT device cybersecurity technical and non-technical capabilities (which will be referred to from this point forward as the “Federal Profile”) based primarily on the guidance used by Federal agencies in NIST SP 800-53 under FISMA. The Federal Profile identifies a catalog of technical and non-technical capabilities that are necessary for any type of IoT device used within a federal environment. This catalog builds on the structure of NISTIR 8259A by expanding the depth of definitions for technical capabilities through new sub-levels of detail known as “sub-capabilities”. The sub-capabilities are either composed of individual bullets that are identified as “elements” for technical capabilities or “actions” (for either the manufacturer or the federal agency) for non-technical capabilities. The Federal Profile may also be useful to non-federal organizations, or they may choose to create their own baseline profiles by choosing a different set of capabilities, sub-capabilities and elements from the catalog.

Ultimately, the goal is to enable federal agencies to securely incorporate IoT devices into their systems and meet security requirements for federal information and information systems. The future Federal Profile aims to help manufacturers looking at federal customers and use cases to go beyond identifying the types of cybersecurity capabilities listed in NISTIR 8259A to considering additionally needed technical and non-technical cybersecurity capabilities.

## We need your feedback

NIST is asking for feedback on this initial catalog for the Federal Profile through the following questions:

1. For any given technical capability and sub-capability, have we identified the most common, or expected, device cybersecurity capability or sub-capability that should be built within an IoT device?

2. Are there any common IoT device technical cybersecurity capabilities or sub-capabilities that we have not included? Please describe.

3. Do you have any suggested updates or additions to elements of device cybersecurity capabilities and sub-capabilities, or suggestions for re-arranging the elements (for technical capabilities) or actions (for non-technical capabilities)? Please describe.

4. Is this structure (i.e., capability -> sub-capability -> element / action) useful for defining device cybersecurity capabilities and IoT device customer controls?

5. Are there any common IoT device non-technical manufacturer capabilities or IoT device customer controls that we have not included? Please describe.

6. Do you have any suggested updates or additions to the non-technical capabilities and associated actions for either the manufacturer or the federal agency? Please describe.

7. Do you find it useful to have the technical capabilities catalog separate from the non-technical capabilities and controls catalog? Why or why not?

8. Would mapping the catalog elements to NISTIR 8259A, NIST SP 800-53 (Rev 4 or Rev 5), or the NIST Cybersecurity Framework be helpful? Are there any other mappings that would also be useful?
