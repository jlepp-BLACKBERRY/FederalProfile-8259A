- Ability to update the software by authorized entities only using a secure and configurable mechanism.
- Ability to identify the current version of the organizational audit policies and procedures governing the software update. NOTE: Should this be in the non-technical catalog? Or, are these intended to be configurable policies that communicate with the device?
- Ability to restrict software installations to only authorized individuals or processes. 
- Ability to restrict software changes to only authorized individuals or processes. 
- Ability to verify change requests come from valid sources using an effective method (e.g., checksums, certificate validation, etc).
