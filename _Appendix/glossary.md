# Appendix Glossary of Terms, Acronyms, and Notations

_This appendix is informative._ It describes the vocabulary and textual representations used in the document.


## Notations

This Standard uses the following typographical conventions in text:

- ASN.1 data types are represented in a `monospaced font`. For example, `SignedData` and `SignerInfo` are data types
    defined for digital signatures.
- Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same terms are not in CAPITALS, the term does not represent a normative requirement. 
    - The terms "SHALL" and "SHALL NOT" indicate requirements to be followed strictly in order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is permitted.
    - The terms "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" indicate that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.
    - The terms "MAY" and "NEED NOT" indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the publication.
    - The terms "CAN" and "CANNOT" indicate a possibility and capability, whether material, physical or causal or, in the negative, the absence of that possibility or capability.
